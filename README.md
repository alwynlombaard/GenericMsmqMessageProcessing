Generic Msmq Message Processing
============================
By Alwyn Lombaard

This implementation is non transactional. I have used it in a scenario to record non vital analytics events generated by a web application

Usage
-----

Declare a messsage to process.

```C#
class MyMessage : IMessage
{

}
``` 

###Server###

Start a message processor for it. Typically at app start up. (Using Ninject for IOC in this example)

```C#
var messageProcessor = new MessageProcessor<MyMessage>(kernel.GetService);
messageProcess.Start();
``` 


###Client###

Add a message to the queue.

```C#
...
try
{
	var queue = new MsmqMessageQueueOutbound<MyMessage>();
	var message = new Message();
	donationQueue.Send(message);
}
catch (Exception ex)...
```
